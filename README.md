## Building EnergyPlus Container

To build the EnergyPlus docker image locally, see the following example command for v9.5.0.

```
docker build --target base -t energyplus --build-arg ENERGYPLUS_VERSION=9.5.0 --build-arg ENERGYPLUS_TAG=v9.5.0 --build-arg ENERGYPLUS_SHA=de239b2e5f --build-arg ENERGYPLUS_INSTALL_VERSION=9-5-0 .
```

## Example

To run EnergyPlus you should either mount your directory into the container or create a dependent container where you call `ADD . /var/simdata/energyplus`.

To mount the local folder and run EnergyPlus (on Linux only) make sure that your simulation directory is the current directory and run:

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/var/simdata/energyplus nrel/energyplus /bin/bash -c "cp /usr/local/bin/Energy+.idd /var/simdata/energyplus; cd /var/simdata/energyplus && EnergyPlus"
```
